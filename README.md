Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphanumeric characters.

Some examples:

* "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
* "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
* "aabcdeB" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
* "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i'
* "Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' and 's'
* "aa11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
